## Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. To set them up, follow these steps:

1. Install pre-commit if you haven't already:

    ```shell
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2. Install the pre-commit hooks to your local Git repository:

    ```shell
    pre-commit install
    ```

3. (optional) To run the pre-commit hooks manually on all files, use:

    ```shell
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```
